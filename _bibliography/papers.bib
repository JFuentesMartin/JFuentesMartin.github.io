    abstract={Functional methods can be applied to the quantum effective action to efficiently determine counterterms and matching conditions for effective field theories. We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.},

We progress towards this goal by determining the RG equations for a simplified version of the SMEFT without any fermion fields. Our calculation relies on functional methods that are newly developed for multi-loop computations and adapted for the determination of RG equations here.},

    abstract={Flavor deconstruction refers to ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model where the gauge group is split into multiple factors under which fermions transform non-universally. We propose a mechanism for charging same-family fermions into different factors of a deconstructed gauge theory in a way that gauge anomalies are avoided. The mechanism relies in the inclusion of a strongly-coupled sector, responsible of both anomaly cancellation and the breaking of the non-universal gauge symmetry. As an application, we propose different flavor deconstructions of the Standard Model that, instead of complete families, uniquely identify specific third-family fermions. All these deconstructions allow for a new physics scale that can be as low as few TeV and provide an excellent starting point for the explanation of the Standard Model flavor hierarchies.},

    abstract={We present a systematic method for determining the two-loop effective Lagrangian resulting from integrating out a set of heavy particles in an ultraviolet scalar theory. We prove that the matching coefficients are entirely determined from the (double-)hard region of the loop integrals and present a master formula for matching, applicable to both diagrammatic and functional approaches. We further employ functional methods to determine compact expressions for the effective Lagrangian that do not rely on any previous knowledge of its structure or symmetries. The same methods are also applicable to the computation of renormalization group equations. We demonstrate the application of the functional approach by computing the two-loop matching coefficients and renormalization group equations in a scalar toy model.},

    abstract={In the presence of axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to the Standard Model via dimension-five interactions, dimension-six SMEFT interactions are generated via renormalization-group evolution. As many of these SMEFT contributions are experimentally tightly constrained, this “ALP-SMEFT interference” can be used to derive indirect bounds on the ALP couplings to the Standard Model particles. We present a global analysis of the Wilson coefficients of the ALP effective Lagrangian based on Higgs, top, and low-energy data. The obtained bounds are model independent and are competitive or even stronger than direct bounds in the GeV to TeV ALP-mass range.},

We introduce the first public version of Matchete, a computer tool for matching weakly-coupled models at one-loop order. It uses functional methods to directly compute all matching contributions in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner, while simplification methods eliminate redundant operators from the output. We sketch the workings of the program and provide examples of how to match simple Standard Model extensions.

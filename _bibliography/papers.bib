We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.},

    abstract={Flavor deconstruction refers to ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model where the gauge group is split into multiple factors under which fermions transform non-universally. We propose a mechanism for charging same-family fermions into different factors of a deconstructed gauge theory in a way that gauge anomalies are avoided. The mechanism relies in the inclusion of a strongly-coupled sector, responsible of both anomaly cancellation and the breaking of the non-universal gauge symmetry. As an application, we propose different flavor deconstructions of the Standard Model that, instead of complete families, uniquely identify specific third-family fermions. All these deconstructions allow for a new physics scale that can be as low as few TeV and provide an excellent starting point for the explanation of the Standard Model flavor hierarchies.},

Modern Effective Field Theory matching techniques relying on the method of expansion by regions have to be extended to account for this. After illustrating the importance of these shifts in two specific examples, we compute the finite shifts required to remove all evanescent operators appearing in the one-loop matching of generic ultraviolet theories to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and elucidate the formalism for generic Effective Field Theory calculations.},

Our study starts from a model-independent effective field-theory approach and then considers both a simplified model and a UV-complete extension of the Standard Model featuring a vector leptoquark $U_1$ as the main mediator of the anomalies. We show that the new LHCb data corroborate the emerging pattern of a new, predominantly left-handed, semileptonic current-current interaction with a flavor structure respecting a (minimally) broken $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry. New aspects of our analysis include a combined analysis of the semileptonic operators involving tau leptons, including in particular the important constraint from $B_s$--$\bar B_s$ mixing, a systematic study of the effects of right-handed leptoquark couplings and of deviations from minimal flavor-symmetry breaking, a detailed analysis of various rare $B$-decay modes which would provide smoking-gun signatures of this non-standard framework (LFV decays, di-tau modes, and $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar\nu$), and finally an updated analysis of collider bounds on the leptoquark mass and couplings.},

The key feature of the model is a breaking of the Pati-Salam and electroweak gauge symmetries localized on opposite sites, communicated to the other sites in an attenuated manner via nearest-neighbor interactions. We show that in this context gauge-singlet fermions localized on each site, receiving hierarchical Majorana masses, can allow the implementation of an inverse seesaw mechanism leading to light anarchic neutrino masses consistent with data. The continuum limit of this three-site setup has a natural interpretation in terms of a warped extra dimension with three defects, where the required exponential hierarchies can be achieved from O(1) differences in the bulk field masses.},

    abstract={We present a model for third-family quark-lepton unification at the TeV scale featuring a composite Higgs sector. The model is based on a variant of the Pati-Salam model, the so-called 4321 model, consisting of the gauge group SU(4)×SU(3)′×SU(2)L×U(1)X . The spontaneous symmetry breaking to the SM gauge group is triggered dynamically by a QCD-like confining sector. The same strong dynamics also produces the Higgs as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson, connecting the energy scales of both sectors. The model predicts a massive U1 vector leptoquark coupled dominantly to the third generation, recently put forward as a possible solution to the B -meson anomalies.},

In addition, DsixTools also contains modules devoted to the matching to the $\Delta B = \Delta S = 1,2$ and $\Delta B = \Delta C = 1$ operators of the Weak Effective Theory at the electroweak scale and their QCD and QED Renormalization Group Evolution below the electroweak scale.},
